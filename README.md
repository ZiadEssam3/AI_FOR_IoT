### ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone!

This repository demonstrates my journey into the world of **AI for IoT**, where Iâ€™ve combined artificial intelligence techniques with IoT devices and cloud technologies to build smart, connected solutions.

---

### ðŸš€ What I've Learned

- âœ… **Python Programming** for AI and device control logic  
- âœ… **OpenCV** for image processing and real-time computer vision applications  
- âœ… **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, face detection, and gesture recognition  
- âœ… Concepts of **interfacing with cameras**, accessing video feeds, and processing frames in real time  
- âœ… **AWS Cloud Services** for scalable and secure data handling  
- âœ… **DynamoDB** for managing device data and user information in the cloud
